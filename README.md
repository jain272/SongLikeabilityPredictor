# SongLikeabilityPredictor
Semester Project for CS 373 : Spring 2021

The code attached allows us to learn and predict the danceability and valence of songs using ML classifiers like Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbours.

The dataset used for the project was the Spotify Dataset of songs between 1921 and 2020 and can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data.csv
